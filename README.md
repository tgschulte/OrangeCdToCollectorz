# OrangeCdToCollectorz
Convert OrangeCd export XML to Collectorz-style XML

I have used this to successfully export opver 8000 albums from OrangeCD and into Collectorz. The output proved too big for Collectorz, which could not open the import file. After splitting it in two files using a text editor, it took both halves successfully.
